## 🎯 Learning Path

### **Beginner Level (Problems 1-22)**
- Arrays & Basic Operations
- Strings & Basic Manipulation  
- Basic Searching & Sorting
- Basic Math Problems

### **Intermediate Level (Problems 23-55)**
- Advanced Array Problems
- String Processing
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Binary Trees (Basic)
- Dynamic Programming (Basic)

### **Advanced Level (Problems 56-100)**

## 🔧 Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaScript_DSA.git
   cd JavaScript_DSA
   ```

2. **Configure your environment:**
   - Copy `.env` file and customize your settings
   - Adjust learning preferences and goals

3. **Start solving:**
   - Read problems in `Questions/questions.txt`
   - Create your solution files in `Answers/` folder
   - Your solutions will be kept private (not pushed to Git)

## 🚫 Privacy Protection

Your solution files are automatically excluded from Git commits:
- All files in `Answers/` folder
- Any files ending with `-solutions.js` or `-solution.js`
- Personal notes and practice files
- Environment configuration files

This ensures you can:
- Keep your solutions private
- Share the question structure with others
- Collaborate on problem sets without revealing answers

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Read the problem** from `Questions/questions.txt`
2. **Create solution file** in `Answers/` folder (e.g., `1.js` for problem 1)
3. **Implement your solution** with proper comments
4. **Test your code** with the provided examples
5. **Analyze time/space complexity**
6. **Move to the next problem**

## 🎯 Study Tips

- Start with beginner problems and progress gradually
- Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions
- Practice regularly and consistently
- Time yourself to improve speed
- Write clean, readable code with comments
- Analyze different approaches for each problem
- Review and optimize your solutions

## 🏆 Progress Tracking

Use the `.env` file to customize your learning experience:
- Set daily problem targets
- Enable progress tracking
- Configure difficulty progression
- Set study session timers

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to:
- Add new problems to the question set
- Improve problem descriptions
- Suggest better approaches
- Share learning resources

**Note:** Do not commit solution files - keep them private!

## 📝 Problem Categories

- **Arrays & Strings** - Fundamental operations and manipulations
- **Searching & Sorting** - Classic algorithms and optimizations
- **Linked Lists** - Pointer manipulation and traversal
- **Trees & Graphs** - Hierarchical and network data structures
- **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization and memoization
- **Backtracking** - Constraint satisfaction problems
- **Advanced Data Structures** - Heaps, Tries, Union-Find, etc.
