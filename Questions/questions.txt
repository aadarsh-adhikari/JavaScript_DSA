# JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms - Beginner to Advanced

## BEGINNER LEVEL DSA PROBLEMS


1.  Given an array of integers and a target sum, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.
    Example: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 → Output: [0,1]

2. Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
    Example  Input: x = 121 Output: true 
3. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
    If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
    Example 1 Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"] Output: "fl"
